##Suggested Activities <span class="arrowh2"></span>

###<i>Frankenstein</i><span class="arrowh3"></span>

Julia Bninski's assignment asks students to compare textual differences between the 1818 and 1831 editions of <i>Frankenstein</i> using Juxta Commons. This assignment invites students to pay close attention to diction and puntuation, arguing from textual evidence (rather than summarizing), and exploring differences in characterization. In addition to an assignment sheet, Bninski also includes examples of student findings, suggestions for improvement, and thoughts on generalizing the assignment.

###Visualizing textual difference in Juxta and Mandala <span class="arrowh3"></span>

###Collation and Writing Pedagogy <span class="arrowh3"></span>

Brandon Walsh's assignment invites students to visualize and refine their composition and revision process via Juxta Commons. Ask students to compose a piece of draft writing and revise it through several iterations. The students may then collate the multiple versions of their writing using Juxta Commons, examining sources of strength and difficulty (such as transitions, logic, etc.). Walsh's post comes with a student produced example of the assignment, as well as a broad examination of collation and writing pedagogy.

###Viewing editorial changes to online articles <span class="arrowh3"></span>

This exercise asks students to view editorial changes to online documents, including news media, editorials, terms of service agreements, and more. Ask students to collate two versions of an edited online text to see changes made after its initial publication. Students may consider how elements including audience, tone, and purpose influence editorial changes, as well as discussing the impact of electronic distribution and revision on editorial practices.

This exercise is inspired by [Andrew Stauffer](https://twitter.com/Andrew_Stauffer) and [Dana Wheeles](https://twitter.com/bluesaepe)'s Scholarslab presentation "Using Juxta in the Classroom," shared as a [Scholarslab Podcast](http://scholarslab.org/podcasts/scholars-lab-presentation-using-juxta-commons-in-the-classroom/). It may be used with texts collated on Juxta, such as the [<i>New York Times</i> article on Health Care](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/ZHOLOJ) and the [Instagram Terms of Service](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/MItAtV).
