##Ongoing questions

* Parsing "general resource" content from course-specific content. Should content specific to certain books and lesson plans be integrated?
* ...and, respecting students' and instructor's IP. Should sample student responses be posted? They are, indeed anonymized. Is there content that instructors have generated for their courses that they don't want made public? This echoes some of my concerns above.
* Are the youtube videos working?
* It looks like Google's embedded viewer doesn't like .doc files. So I'll have to work on cleaning those up.
