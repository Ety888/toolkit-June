##Thinking Through Infrastructure

We’ve recently completed a review of our shared workflow in the lab, focusing on how we manage our collaborative tasks, log our research, and share our discoveries with each other and with a larger public online. As part of my research this summer, I’m testing and implementing our workflow as we look toward the kits for cultural history and z-axis initiatives in the coming year. I want to examine our workflow method in the lab, focusing on it’s role in scholarly communication, scaled collaboration, and graduate student professionalization.

As my title suggests, the tools, practices, techniques, and shared values not only inform the work we do, but also reflect our shared praxis and its relation to humanities scholarship. As Alan Liu has recently suggested: “Just as meaning [in the Digital Humanities] is both a metavalue and a metaproblem, so is collaboration as it bears on such urgent issues in the digital humanities as coauthorship, collective project building, multigraph books, open peer review, social media, crowdsourcing, and the hiring and promotion implications of all these.” Thinking critically about how we work as a team allows graduate researchers to explore the place of their work in relation to emergent changes in the discipline, and to do so through the everyday practice of research. As such, our choices about infrastructure emerge from discussions at the recent Scholarly Communication Institute meetings on [Rethinking Graduate Education](http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/), and respond to changes in the discipline advocated by Bethany Nowviskie, Kari Kraus, and Kathleen Fitzpatrick.

As I begin reading for my comprehensive exams in the Digital Humanities this Fall, working through digital methods as they register changes in the discipline more broadly adds an embodied, engaged, and tacit element to my graduate education that reading alone cannot provide. I will therefore pull back for an overview of the landscape of tools and practices we’ve chosen to implement before returning to a view on the ground, where I will discuss the importance of humanities lab infrastructures in rethinking how graduate students approach their research.

The Maker Lab’s workflow is divided into three principal sections: task management, logs, and blog posts. My time in the lab usually begins with a quick review of my ongoing projects and deadlines, which we manage using Asana. Asana’s web application lets us set due dates for tasks, share draft documents and other resources we’ve discovered, and send brief updates on the status of our work. By consolidating project updates, progress, and deadlines into one place, Asana eliminates the need to dig through my inbox before returning to work on a project. Reducing e-mail is key to ensuring that project details don’t become fragmented and that collaborators remain updated with ease.

Logging our work in the lab is managed through GitHub, using a shared logs folder in the lab’s repository. Each log is maintained as a markdown file, with new shifts added under a header for each date. For each lab shift, I typically log a list of work done along with screen grabs and a list of ideas and concerns for the day. These updates are then pushed from my local machine to the main branch using the GitHub client. This method allows us to maintain local access to our logs without relying on internet access. Pushing updates through text and screen grabs to the shared repository online (where the markdown is displayed as html) also asks researchers to work through how this becomes that as we compose and format our logs, push them from our local machines, and maintain conversations via GitHub. Working through GitHub promotes the concerns and approaches we share in the lab, and it does so by asking collaborators to focus not only on what work we do as a team, but how we do it.

We also use GitHub to facilitate conversations between researchers and directors. In my experience, the log functions more as a conversational space than a record—I push the work I’ve done in a shift along with thoughts, roadblocks, and concerns, which are then taken up using the comments function in GitHub. The blend of online communication (using comments in Asana and GitHub) and face-to-face collaboration (in the space of the lab) creates a feedback loop through which record keeping becomes a venue for articulating and working through new ideas about the work we do. In a lab whose focus is on humanistic inquiry, cultivating these moments of shared critical reflection through the platforms we use promotes the blend of algorithmic and critical inquiry that lies at the center of digital humanities research.

The findings of our work is shared with a larger public through blog posts to the Maker Lab website. We each author roughly two posts per semester, with progress toward completion tracked using Asana, drafts and working thoughts shared via our logs, and final drafts submitted for review before being published on the site. Integrating the documentation we generate across a range of media is a key element of composing the posts. So far, we’ve worked with video and audio, posters, exhibits, fabricated objects, and a range of tools, methods, and texts. Communicating our work through a suite of media, from screengrabs, to text, to high definition video, invites us to work through platforms and strategies for sharing digital work on the web.

Together, these three key elements of our shared workflow—task management, logging with GitHub, and authoring blog posts—compose a set of shared resources and methods that teach us how humanities research can be collaboratively undertaken and shared with larger communities. However, these screen-based interfaces are also blended with hand-driven counterparts maintained in the space of the lab. Planning meetings for new projects always begin at the whiteboard, where we work through our thoughts as a group and draft them on the board. New items of interest are displayed on the large monitor in the lab, and often prompt discussion as we turn from our workstations to discuss our shared problems in person. Questions about a research problem are solved by pulling a book from the shelves in the corner and consulting with a neighbor. When I conceive of shared workflow as lab infrastructure, I don’t only refer to a set of tools and tasks, but also to the objects, surfaces, and spaces through which collaborators share their ideas.

Communicating through these resources, both on-screen and in-hand, lets us conceive of our graduate work at a range of scales. While devising my workflow for a new task, I will also think about how that workflow could be shared via GitHub for others to fork and deploy at their home institutions. Working in the lab asks me to consider what material collaborative projects and spaces produce and what venues, methods, and media exist for sharing that material with others engaged in similar work. I find that as we conduct our daily research in the lab, my fellow graduate researchers and I continually assess how scholarly communication functions across a range of scales, from the collaborator across the room, to research partners on skype, to local and larger disciplinary communities. By enmeshing research practices in shared infrastructure, our workflow reconceives of solitary research activities as collaborative practices that engage larger publics.

###Read [Rethinking Graduate Education, Meeting 1](http://uvasci.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/final-report.pdf)

* Integrating shared workflow and blog posting into existing lab infrastructure (as the site addresses a larger public) offers a venue for graduate students to think about how work in and around DH centers scales across a variety of contexts (a consideration typically reserved for those higher up the chain).

###Read [Rethinking Graduate Education, Meeting 2](http://uvasci.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Report_SCIGradEd_11MAR13.pdf)

* Stop focusing on describing data and start producing it. Scholarship doesn't describe things; it does things.
* How does workflow integrate into MA & PhD career/trajectory planning?
* Could riff on concept of exchange, particularly across different levels of prof. dev. What does it mean to exchange/conversate with colleagues at various levels across various projects?
* …but also reframing. Again, the content/method split is a false binary. Id' suggest the answer rather lies in shared sets of *problems* that we work through collaboratively.

###Reviewed ["Survey of DH Centers in the US"](http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/reports/pub143)

* How does our workflow respond to the issue of DH centers becoming silos? How do we *exchange* and collaborate across a range of scales--in the lab, on campus, with our colleagues at various institutions, and with a broader public? These aren't considerations that become tacked-on at the last minute as we present our work for public display, but are rather baked into the way we work and think together on our projects/problems.
* How does scholarly communication & collaboration scale up from the local level? I'd suggest that thinking about workflows as shareable, interoperable, and refractable is key.

###Read ["Rebooting Graduate Education in the Humanities"](http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/01/07/rebooting-graduate-education-in-the-humanities/)

* Problem-based approaches to collaboration reframes graduate education. The work we undertake together is as much about the scholarly problems we are trying to solve as what methods, skills, and tools we bring together to solve them. Thinking about workflow necessarily involves developing a range of skills and approaches situated within contexts that include, but are not limited to, the traditional work of the academy.

##Notes

* One key difference I'm noticing between using Git/GitHub for logs: I felt more comfortable logging incomplete work in a GDoc than I do in an .md file. For instance, the last two notes above feel out of place here. We'll see if my perspective on this changes over time.

### Jentery's Feedback on the Log for 28 June 2013

Don't you love the language around producing data (rather than describing things)? It motivates the lab's research, for sure.  And as you probably guessed, the problems-based emphasis of "Rebooting" is in part informed by my work with Ray on new approaches to modelling and prototyping. I'm also fond of that perspective :) 

Elsewhere, keep me posted on this bit: "I felt more comfortable logging incomplete work in a GDoc than I do in an .md file." What about the absence of the page in a text editor? Or the lack of a WYSIWYG editor? All of which is to say: I'm curious how software design influences your perception of complete / incomplete. To be sure, preferences differ from person to person.

##Drafted Working Notes

* Look into issues tracker in Guthub [also used by Scholarslab folks](http://www.scholarslab.org/grad-student-research/reflections-on-project-management-i/ )
* Importance of thinking through infrastructure (pun intended). Touches on knowing/doing, collaboration, and graduate education.
* Conversations are key (both in-person and online)
* fostering shared culture, shared ways of knowing/doing, and venues for collaboration...
* …in other words, collaboration doesn’t just happen—-it needs to be cultivated
* articulate principles behind shared infrastructure

###Notes from my perspective

* Cohort formation and collaborative planning (how what may be conceived of as a solitary activity is actually embroiled in questions of collaboration, professionalization, the changing profession, and scale). Think of lab planning related to reading group, comps reading & dissertation planning, and appeal of humanities training. Thinking about shared workflow involves rethinking the contexts for graduate work in the humanities.
* Value of this type of training: the role tools play in shared work, project planning, work culture, etc.
* Why is it important for RAs to work through these infrastructures, rather than having them simply passed down from above? Because the underlying issue at stake is humanities training(?)
* Think more broadly about planning communication & collaboration infrastructure for whole lab in the coming year. What issues are we looking toward?
* What are we collecting? What data are we *producing* and how will it be used?

###Looking toward use cases in the coming year

* Forking workflows
* …and, in related practice, publishing workflows we’ve tested  in the lab.
How do labs communicate? What practices can we share and what would that look like?
* What material do collaborative projects/spaces produce and what venues, media, infrastructures exist for sharing that material?
* How does scholarly communication function across a range of scales? On the local level? On the www level? Across research partners? Engaging with a larger public?

### Jentery's Feedback on the Log for 25 June 2013

I like this language and perspective, especially the emphasis on blending technology and culture: "Thinking about shared workflow involves rethinking the contexts for graduate work in the humanities." The comparison with reading groups is compelling, too.  

I also appreciate an inquiry into how labs communicate. Last year, I felt as tho the work was too individuated. Know what I mean? A lot of one-to-one communication (at least in terms of logs) between me and GRAs. It'll be good to open it up and share process? Looking forward to reading more! Thanks, Alex!
