###Overview <span class="arrowh3"></span>

Zotero is an open source tool used to store, cite, and share research material. Zotero can pull a variety of electronic sources and grab content from the web with a single click. Working with the tool, researchers can create a personal research archive, generate citation material, create collaborative bibliographic records online, and much more.

###Documentation <span class="arrowh3"></span>

##Suggested Activities <span class="arrowh2"></span>

### Introduction to Zotero <span class="arrowh3"></span>

The Ballod Library hosts a lesson plan for introducing students to Zotero. This lesson teaches students how to incorporate Zotero into their research, recognize different types of sources, edit bibliographic information, and manage their Zotero account. It was created by Lauren Bradley, Andrea Daniele, and Liza Oldham and is adaptable to a variety of students and course levels.

### Web research exercise <span class="arrowh3"></span>

Ask students to collect, evaluate, and compare web-based resources using Zotero. Using the tool to pair citation with evaluation of content will help students build digital literacy to parse rich sources from content farms and the like.

### A collaborative class reading list <span class="arrowh3"></span>

Use [Zotero Groups](https://www.zotero.org/groups/) to build a collaborative class library with students. Transforming the work of amassing and citing sources into a social knowledge creation project invites students to build valuable clusters of sources, rather than focus primarily on formatting conventions.
