###Overview <span class="arrowh3"></span>

Zotero is a research tool used to store, cite, and share content. Zotero can pull a variety of electronic sources and grab content from the web with a single click. Working with the tool, researchers can create a personal research archive, generate citation material, create collaborative bibliographic records online, and much more.

###Documentation <span class="arrowh3"></span>

##Suggested Activities <span class="arrowh2"></span>

### Web research exercise <span class="arrowh3"></span>

Ask students to collect, evaluate, and compare web-based resources using Zotero. Using the tool to pair bibliographic detail and citation with evaluation of content will help students build digital literacy to parse rich sources from content farms and the like.

### A collaborative class reading list <span class="arrowh3"></span>

Use [Zotero Groups](https://www.zotero.org/groups/) to build a collaborative class library with students. Transforming the work of amassing and citing sources into a social knowledge creation project invites students to focus on building valuable clusters of sources, rather than focus primarily on formatting conventions.
